# Social Preview

`‚öôÔ∏èüñºÔ∏è‚ÑπÔ∏è Information on social preview image usage by @seanpm2001`

## Source

A copy of the images, along with their project files, are included at [:octocat: `seanpm2001-GraphicDesign`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GraphicDesign/)

## Reference

The social preview image used on each repository is located within [`/.github/SocialPreview/`](/.github/SocialPreview/) unused images (either because I didn't like them as much, or because they were over 1 MiB, GitHubs limit) are located in [`/.github/SocialPreview/Unused/`](/.github/SocialPreview/Unused/)

## Usage

Social Preview images are used on all developed repositories. They are images that show up when viewing my repositories via web search, GitHub topics, or source code search.
